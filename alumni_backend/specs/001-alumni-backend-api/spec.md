## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT alumni users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Alumni users need a social platform where they can connect with fellow graduates, share life updates through posts with images, engage with content through likes and comments, and maintain their professional alumni profile. The platform requires moderation capabilities for administrators to maintain community standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an alumni user has valid credentials, **When** they log into the platform, **Then** they see a personalized feed of posts from their alumni network
2. **Given** a user wants to share an update, **When** they create a post with text and image, **Then** the post appears in the community feed for others to see and interact with
3. **Given** a user sees a post they appreciate, **When** they like or comment on it, **Then** their engagement is recorded and the post author is notified
4. **Given** a user sees inappropriate content, **When** they report the post or comment, **Then** administrators are notified for review and action
5. **Given** an administrator reviews reported content, **When** they determine it violates community guidelines, **Then** they can remove the content and take appropriate action
6. **Given** an administrator wants to highlight important announcements, **When** they pin a post, **Then** it appears prominently at the top of the community feed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to delete content they don't own?
- How does the system handle users reporting content maliciously?
- What occurs when an administrator account tries to create a personal profile?
- How are replies to comments handled when the original comment is deleted?
- What happens to user-generated content when a user account is deactivated?
